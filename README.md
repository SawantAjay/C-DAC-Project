# C-DAC-Project
This project involves developing a Sensor Network System using the CAN protocol with STM32 and ESP32 controllers for real-time, reliable data communication. The system integrates sensors like DHT11 (temperature and humidity), PIR (motion detection), Flame Sensor, and MQ2 (air quality) to collect and process environmental data.
Using IoT connectivity, data is transmitted to a cloud platform via the ESP32, enabling remote monitoring and analysis. The combination of the CAN protocol and IoT ensures efficient, error-free communication, making the system ideal for applications in industrial automation, smart homes, and environmental monitoring.
